# DB-SQL

The intention of this study repo, is to reinforce knowledge in Relational Databases, using SQL, aiming towards learning PostgresSQL, once it's going to be the main DBMS used on TT003/ST060 - Advanced Topics in Databases discipline @UNICAMP. It will be my final discipline in college, so I want to be prepared to face all challenges that are about to come, even though they are hard or not. The study roadmap that's being used is: DBR using SQL w/ MySQL, DBOR using PostGresSQL, and finally, MongoDB as a NoSQL solution. My final goal is to apply the Database knowledge acquired in this study effort to API building and Data Analysis/AI tasks

During this studies, MySQL was the chosen DBMS, so the code syntax found here is all related to MySQL.

You'll find several repositories, using SQL commands and principles like: Creating/Deleting Tables; Updating tables; Inserting data into tables; Primary and Foreign Key uses; Types of Joins uses; use of booleans and conditionals; Ordering values; Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF); Aggregate functions and Subqueries.
