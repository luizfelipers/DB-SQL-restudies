# DB-SQL

The intention of this study repo, is to reinforce knowledge in Relational Databases, using SQL, aiming towards learning PostgresSQL, once it's going to be the main DBMS used on TT003/ST060 - Advanced Topics in Databases discipline @UNICAMP. It will be my final discipline in college, so I want to be prepared to face all challenges that are about to come, even though they are hard or not.

During this studies, MySQL was the chosen DBMS, so the code syntax found here is all related to MySQL.
